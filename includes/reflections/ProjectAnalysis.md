# Project Analysis

> What is missing?

- I do not think that anything is missing for this project. However, the project could definitely be improved. I feel like adding AI would probably take this to the next level.

> What can be improved?

- The responsiveness of the items on different screen sizes could definitely be better. The layout and quality of code could also be improved to be more efficient. The code works but is really ugly to look at. More commenting could also have helped this issue.

> How would you approach a project like this in the future?

- I would probably research the game more and then try to understand and break down the parts I need. After that, I would have a better idea of how to structure the classes within the project. Not procastinating would also be very helpful for future projects. Also, having a little more time to understand pygame would have made this project a little easier and less time consuming. 

> What is your suggestion for students doing a similar project? 

- My suggestion for students...
  -  Start as early as possible. 
  -  You do not need to know everything.
  -  Break down the project before you code anything.
  -  Document the progress of your project so that when you come back to it, you are not clueless about what is happening.

> What is your suggestion for this project in future courses?

- My suggestion for this project...
  - Give the instructions at the start of the class, so that people have time to think about it throughout the semester.
  - Stress the need for commenting, design documents, and documentation.
  - Teach how to break down the game into classes.
